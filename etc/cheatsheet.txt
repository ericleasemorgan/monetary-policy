Becoming Self-Relieant
======================

This is a cheatsheet outlining how you can create your own time series
data for Project Monetary Policy.

First, you will need to log into the remote computer. Open your Terminal
application and enter the following command:

  ssh xliao@rdr-compute.crc.nd.edu

You ought to be prompted for your NetID password. Enter it.

Next, you need to change to the directory where your/our project is
located. Use this command:

  cd /shared/projects/monetary-policy
  
Third, whenever you cd ("change directories"), it is good idea to pwd
("present working directory") to confirm your location:

  pwd

If the result is not "/shared/projects/monetary-policy", then you probably
entered the cd command incorrectly.

Fourth, it is then a good idea to see what content is in this directory,
and you use the ls ("list") command, like this:

  ls -l
  
You ought to see something like this:

  total 24
  drwxrwxr-x 2 emorgan campus   195 Oct 25 11:46 bin
  drwxrwxr-x 6 emorgan campus    74 Oct 25 11:36 corpus
  drwxrwxr-x 2 emorgan campus   276 Oct 25 11:50 etc
  -rwxrwxr-x 1 emorgan campus 18092 Oct 25 11:26 LICENSE
  -rwxrwxr-x 1 emorgan campus   708 Oct 25 11:43 README.md
  drwxr-xr-x 2 xliao   campus    32 Oct 31 10:12 tmp

These are all the files and directories of the project.

To create your time series data, you first need to review your lexicon.
You can do that like this:

  cat ./etc/lexicon.txt

Is it correct? If not, then you need to edit the lexicon.txt file. Use
the nano command, and use the resulting prompts to edit, save, and quit
the editing process:

  nano ./etc/lexicon.txt
  
Once the lexicon is to your liking, then create the time series:

  ./bin/count-lexicon.py 

You ought to see a stream of CSV (comman-separated values) text. Run the
command again, but this time save the stream to a file:

  ./bin/./bin/count-lexicon.py  > ./tmp/time-series.csv
  
How do you get the file to your computer? Here is a way to send it to
yourself via email:

  echo "The time series is attached" | mailx -s "time series" -a ./tmp/time-series.csv xliao@nd.edu

Go to the beginning until you are satisfied with the result.
